# Bot lib bot template

## setup

```shell
pre-commit install
```

## [WIP] instructions
### Prerequisites
- Pycharm professional (everything else works as well, but not documented and you will have to figure it out / troubleshoot on your own)

### guide to Victor
- [ ] Install Poetry (using pip, terminal, or any method)
```brew install poetry```
- [ ] Create a new repo using the bot-lib-template repo as a template: https://github.com/calmmage/bot-lib-bot-template
- [ ] Clone the new repo
- [ ] Open with PyCharm (it will automatically create an environment from Poetry)
- [ ] Create a bot using @BotFather
- [ ] Copy the token into the .env file (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=) - rename example.env to .env 
- [ ] Run the project by clicking the green button in PyCharm in the run.py file
- [ ] If something goes wrong, clone this repo and start from there: dev/example_1 https://github.com/calmmage/something-fun


### More ideas - write down details
- Rename project to your project name (folder and in pyproject.toml)

### temporary troubleshooting
